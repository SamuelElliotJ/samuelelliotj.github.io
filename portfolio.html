                <p>"The path is paved in stone... Your own"</p>
                <p>Petrifact is a short puzzle / platforming game based around the player being able to petrify their body
                    in order to activate traps and open doors. This game was made in 5 days as part of the Jamsepticeye
                    games jam and everything in the game was made by 4 people. The game is still being worked on as a hobby
                    project!

                <p>Get Reel is a project that was made in 8 weeks as part of my third year senior collaborative module.
                    For this project I acted as both the Team lead and Tech lead, most of my time being devoted to the
                    technical side of the project. The mechanics I worked on include the UI, fishing rod, spear, net, shop
                    and inventory. I also made sure to effectively communicate with the entire team to keep the project
                    running smoothly.

                <h1>Shuffle</h1>
                <p>Shuffle is a project that was made in 8 weeks as part of my C++ module in University. The goal of the
                    project was to produce a 3D local multiplayer roguelike game inspired by "Crawl". I worked with one
                    other person on this project and integrated C++ with blueprint. The mechanics I worked on include
                    the equip system, attacking / combo system and weapons systems. I also worked on some minor parts of
                    the UI, levelling and win condition.

                <h1>Cat Wizard vs The Dwarves</h1>
                <p>Cat Wizards vs The Dwarves is a project i worked on as part of my junior collaborative games design 
                    module where i worked in a large team to simulate industry in my second year of university. As a 
                    junior on this project i had very little say in the design and direction of the game, I was assigned 
                    tasks via Jira and completed them whilst discussing said mechanics with my seniors in design. 
                    The main mechanics I worked on for this project was the orb weapon with its unique mechanics, and 
                    the UI including the save game and leaderboard.

                <h1>Metal Bard</h1>
                <p>Metal Bard is a project made in my second year of university as part of the Indie Games Development 
                    module. The project was inspired by a game series that I am immensely fond of the "The Legend of 
                    Heroes" series. The main inspiration being the mix of both 2D and 3D elements. I also enjoy rhythm 
                    games and had the idea to use a rhythm mechanic in battle which isn't seen often in games. I made 
                    everything in this project barring some 3D models and 2D sprites.
