                <p>"The path is paved in stone... Your own"</p>
                <p>Petrifact is a short puzzle / platforming game based around the player being able to petrify their body
                    in order to activate traps and open doors. This game was made in 5 days as part of the Jamsepticeye
                    games jam and everything in the game was made by 4 people. The game is still being worked on as a hobby
                    project!
